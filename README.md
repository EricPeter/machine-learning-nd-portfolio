## Projects


### Price Prediction for ecommerce products  
> **Keywords**: Deep Learning | Price Prediction | CNN | Neural Networks | Data exploration. *[View Report](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/projects/price-prediction-capstone/Capstone%20Report.pdf)*, *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/tree/master/projects/price-prediction-capstone)*.

Using the official application of an e-commerce site, a historical sales database corresponding to a product category has been produced. By using this dataset containing all the information related to the products and their corresponding price, it is possible to train an algorithm capable of predicting the optimal competitive price for the publication of a new product. The motivation for pursuing this project is due to the fact that e-commerce companies require a holistic understanding of prices, and they must establish it intelligently as a marketing weapon.

### Image Classification
> **Keywords**: Deep Learning | CNN | Convolutional Neural Network | Image Classification | ResNet. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/projects/image-classification/dog_app.ipynb)*

Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consisted of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The project involed preprocessing the images, then training a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images needed to be normalized and the labels had to be one-hot encoded. Built convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers and see the neural network's predictions on the sample images.


### Creating Customer Segments
> **Keywords**: Unsupervised Learning |  Clustering | PCA | Feature Transformation | Outlier Detection. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/projects/customer-segments/customer_segments.ipynb)*

Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.

### Train a Self Driving Car
> **Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning | Q-Learning | Driving Agent | Optimal Policy | Discount Factor. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/projects/self-driving-car/smartcab.ipynb)*

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

### Titanic Survival Exploration 
> **Keywords**: Data science | Data exploration | NumPy | Pandas | matplotlib | scikit-learn. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/projects/titanic-survival-exploration/titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb)*

Create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. Starting with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.

### Predicting Boston Housing Prices
> **Keywords**: Data science | Prediction | Data Exploration | Grid Search | Cross-Validation. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/projects/boston-housing-prices/boston_housing.ipynb)*

Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

### Finding Donors for CharityML
> **Keywords**: Supervised Learning | Classifiers | Feature Importance | Random forest | KNeighbors. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/projects/finding-donors/finding_donors.ipynb)*

Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.

### Coding a Neural Network
> **Keywords**: Neural Network, Forward Propagation, Backpropagation, Gradient Descent, Tensorflow. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/projects/coding-a-neural-network/coding_a_neural_network.ipynb)*

Build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset. Building a neural network from the ground up to have a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools. The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

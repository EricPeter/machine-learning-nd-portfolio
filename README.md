### Price Prediction for ecommerce products  
> **Keywords**: Deep Learning | Price Prediction | CNN | Neural Networks | Data exploration. *[View Report](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/deep-learning/ml-price-prediction/Capstone%20Report.pdf)*, *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/deep-learning/ml-price-prediction/capstone_project.ipynb)*.

Using the official application of an e-commerce site, a historical sales database corresponding to a product category has been produced. By using this dataset containing all the information related to the products and their corresponding price, it is possible to train an algorithm capable of predicting the optimal competitive price for the publication of a new product. The motivation for pursuing this project is due to the fact that e-commerce companies require a holistic understanding of prices, and they must establish it intelligently as a marketing weapon.

Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consisted of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The project involed preprocessing the images, then training a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images needed to be normalized and the labels had to be one-hot encoded. Built convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers and see the neural network's predictions on the sample images.


## Reinforcement Learning

### Train a Quadcopter How to Fly
> **Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning | Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients | DDPG | Actor-Critic| Experience replay. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/rl-quadcopter/Quadcopter_Project.ipynb)*

Design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The algorithm used was a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) as described in the Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning paper. The choice was based on the requirement to support learning in a continuous action space.

Build a neural network that can learn to play games through reinforcement learning. More specifically, we'll use QQ-learning to train an agent to play a game called Cart-Pole. In this game, a freely swinging pole is attached to a cart. The cart can move to the left and right, and the goal is to keep the pole upright as long as possible.

### Train a Self Driving Car
> **Keywords**: Reinforcement Learning | Q-Learning | Driving Agent | Optimal Policy | Discount Factor. *[View Source](https://github.com/nitsuga1986/machine-learning-nd-portfolio/blob/master/reinforcement-learning/self-driving-car/smartcab.ipynb)*

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.
